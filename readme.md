# Encrypted chat
Acaedmic project. It required to define own standard of encryption and communication protocol. Then I had to implement server part of application (other students developed client applications).

## Executable application
```
cd ./out/artifacts/cipherChat_jar/
java -jar cipherChat.jar
```
